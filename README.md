# manim-algorithm
computer science lib for manim(ce version)

This library is currently in the internal development stage, trying some encapsulations to better allow Manim to display algorithms and data structures, such as linked lists/arrays/binary trees, etc.

I appreciate that the Manim community's spider found this project, but currently, this project does not intend to accept any code contribution until it reaches a certain scale. 

If you have any suggestions or requests, feel free to leave me a message.
